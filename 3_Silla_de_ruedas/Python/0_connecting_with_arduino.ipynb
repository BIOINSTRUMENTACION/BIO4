    "# Communication Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "A communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Communication Protocols:\n",
    "* UART\n",
    "* I2C\n",
    "* SPI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serial communication:\n",
    "Serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus. This is in contrast to parallel communication, where several bits are sent as a whole, on a link with several parallel channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel communication:\n",
    "The basic difference between a parallel and a serial communication channel is the number of electrical conductors used at the physical layer to convey bits. Parallel communication implies more than one such conductor. For example, an 8-bit parallel channel will convey eight bits (or a byte) simultaneously, whereas a serial channel would convey those same bits sequentially, one at a time. If both channels operated at the same clock speed, the parallel channel would be eight times faster. A parallel channel may have additional conductors for other signals, such as a clock signal to pace the flow of data, a signal to control the direction of data flow, and handshaking signals.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Asynchronous communication\n",
    "asynchronous communication is transmission of data, generally without the use of an external clock signal, where data can be transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady stream. Any timing required to recover data from the communication symbols is encoded within the symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant aspect of asynchronous communications is that data is not transmitted at regular intervals, thus making possible variable bit rate, and that the transmitter and receiver clock generators do not have to be exactly synchronized all the time. In asynchronous transmission, data is sent one byte at a time and each byte is preceded by start bit and stop bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous communication\n",
    "Synchronous serial communication describes a serial communication protocol in which \"data is sent in a continuous stream at constant rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronous communication requires that the clocks in the transmitting and receiving devices are synchronized – running at the same rate – so the receiver can sample the signal at the same time intervals used by the transmitter. No start or stop bits are required. For this reason \"synchronous communication permits more information to be passed over a circuit per unit time.  than asynchronous serial communication. Over time the transmitting and receiving clocks will tend to drift apart, requiring resynchronization.\n",

    "## UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)\n",
    "UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. UART’s main purpose is to transmit and receive serial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It only requires 3 wires: Tx (Transmiter), Rx (Reciver) and commun ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\connections.PNG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "UART is:\n",
    "* Serial: The infromation is send bit by bit sequentially\n",
    "* Asyncronous: There is no internal clock\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no clock, how can UART interpret the data?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Before sending the data, UART adds a **START BIT**, a **PARITY BIT**, and a **STOP BIT**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\singal.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol does not have a clock, but is important that both the receiver and the transmiter are configured at the same **BAUD RATE**. This is, the number of bits per second, the most commoun baud rate is 9600, this is, 9600 bits/second.\n",
